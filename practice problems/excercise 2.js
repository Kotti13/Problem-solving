// 2. Write a JavaScript function getDayName that takes a number (from 1 to 7) and returns the corresponding day of the week
// 3. Write a function printMultiplicationTable that takes a number n, range r and prints the multiplication table for that number in reverse order.

// Expected O/P
// 5 * 6 = 30
// 5 * 5 = 25
// 5 * 4 = 20
// 5 * 3 = 15
// 5 * 2 = 10
